## Notes

- Make sure you have an active internet connection to load Google Fonts and fetch weather data.
- The weather data is typically fetched from a public weather API (ensure your `script.js` is configured with a valid API key and endpoint).
- The app is fully client-side and does not require any backend server.

---

## Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No installation required.

*This experiment helps you understand how to build a simple, interactive web application that consumes a public API and updates the UI dynamically using
