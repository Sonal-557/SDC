# Project Overview

This project contains a simple HTML registration form with JavaScript validation. The form is designed to collect user information, including username, password, email, phone number, gender, languages known, and address. The JavaScript function `validate()` ensures that all input fields are filled out correctly before submission, providing user-friendly alerts for any validation errors.

## Files

- **registrationjs.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the registration form along with embedded JavaScript for input validation.

## Instructions for Usage

1. Open the `registrationjs.html` file in a web browser.
2. Fill out the registration form with the required information.
3. Click the "SUBMIT" button to validate the input.
4. If any fields are incorrectly filled or left empty, appropriate alerts will guide you to correct the errors.
5. Once all validations pass, a success message will be displayed.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.
